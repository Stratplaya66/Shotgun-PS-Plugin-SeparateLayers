# Shotgun-PS-Plugin-SeparateLayers
Separate layers plugin created for Photoshop-Shotgun integration. Project for my internship with ZERO VFX.

Plugin created to streamline matte-painting artist workflow. Integration with tk-config files required within artist schema. Validates and publishes the layers of a .psd file to Shotgun.
